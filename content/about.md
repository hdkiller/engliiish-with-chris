# Meet Your Teacher – Chris White

With 30 years of experience, I’ve taught thousands of students, trained teachers, and worked as an IELTS examiner, Cambridge Speaking Examiner, and Academic Manager. I’ve helped students pass exams, professionals advance their careers, and learners gain real confidence in English.

## The Right English Teacher Makes All the Difference

Have you worked with English teachers who couldn't help you achieve the breakthrough you needed? Many students spend years studying English without seeing real progress. The problem often isn't you - it's the approach. As a native English speaker from England now based in Budapest, I offer a different path to English fluency.
